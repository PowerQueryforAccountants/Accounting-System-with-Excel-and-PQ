	Test GL - do i need to put data validation Listing?
		validation listing in the Customer #, Account #, 
		Entering transactions in GL is like entering MJs - Debit as positive and Credit as negative
		Create customer # if the customer is an account customer

	Test Collection system
		make sure the AR acct # is correct
		Make sure the Pivot Table is filtered to the AR account
		fix the button to refresh pivot table

		Create dropdown for Cust Name - make sure it autocompletes

	Create a Supplier Tracking system
		Copy the Collection Sytem
		Create dropdown for Supplier Name - make sure it autocompletes


	Customers
		Data validation hightlight duplicates

	Suppliers
		Data validation hightlight duplicates

	Enter only transactions in the yellow cells
	Reddish highlight for items in the Input area that can't be change


APPROACHES
	* Excel 2016 Dynamic arrays - version sensitive - does not work in TBR excel
		https://www.excelcampus.com/functions/dynamic-array-formulas-spill-ranges/

	* Autocomplete without macro
		* Conditional formatting - highlight if there's duplicate customers - first 50 rows
		* Format the customers as table. Then add a named range to for the CustomersT[Customer Name column]
		* In the GL, add 50 rows IMMEDIATELY above the Customer header - point the cells to the Customer table 50 rows
		* Add a Data validation for Dropdown - in the GL, highlight the first 1000 rows for the destination. Add data validation, use source as customers (the name range you defined earlier)

		* Do this for the the Customer, Supplier, and Account columns
		* Add macro to refresh Pivot Tables

	* Autocomplete using add-in
		https://sites.google.com/site/beyondexcel/project-updates/comboboxdatavalidationadd-in
		Instructions
		Set up the validation as normal
		Advantage: No need for clunky workaround
		Disadvantage: Not online. Will not work on a Mac.
		Workaround: Place it inside a sync folder

		* Do this for the the Customer, Supplier, and Account columns
		* Add macro to refresh Pivot Tables

	* Google sheets
		https://www.ozgrid.com/Excel/autocomplete-validation.htm
		Advantage: Autocomplete feature built in - datasource 50, destination 500
		For the named range, GS does not have a table feature. Hence, use a formula for the dynamic range as source for the data validation

		Lets say your list is on Sheet2 and you wish to use the Validation List with AutoComplete on Sheet1.

		On Sheet1 A1 Enter =Sheet2!A1 and copy down including as many spare rows as needed (say 300 rows total). Hide these rows and use this formula in the Refers to: for a dynamic named range called MyList:

		The equivalent of this is the FILTER
		=OFFSET(Sheet1!$A$5,0,0,MATCH("*",Sheet1!$A$5:$A$54,-1),1)
		=OFFSET(Customers!$A$5,0,0,MATCH("*",Customers!$A$5:$A$54,-1),1)
		=FILTER(Customers!$A$5:$A$54, Customers!$A$5:$A$54 <> "")

		
		Ok, some quirks of Data validation:
		1. If you want a dynamic list, do not use  formula. Instead use a range with indefinite end. A5:A, Customers!A5:A, 'Customer Name'!A5:A
		2. It is because the drop down and autocomplete works only for a defined range. In the above, it will not include blank cells in the drop down
		3. You can manually input the destination range as well as the source range


		Make sure to select from the list before entering a new customer or supplier.

VERDICT:
	Use the Google Sheets for on-the-go system

outline:
* planning the system 
    books needed
        Accounts Table
        General Ledger table - actually more like a General Journal table - debits are positive, credits are negative
        Customer
        Supplier

    reports needed
        trial balance
        balance sheet
        income statement

* Start with the Chart of accounts
    Start with 1 - Asset
    Start with 2 - Liability
    Start with 3 - Equity
    Start with 4 - Revenue
    Start with 5 - Expenses
    
    There could be no duplicate in the Account Name - in database parlance - this is the primary key

* Then create the Customers and Suppliers Table
    Let's assume for now that the Name is the primary key (though in reality, this is not the case)

* Then finally create the General Ledger table
    This is like the General Journal though it is not necessary that transactions are entered chronologically as long as each has associated transaction date
    Utilize data validation for the Account Name, Customer Name, Supplier Name

* Enter some transactions

* Create merge report - Accounts_T and GL_T

* Create reports TB, Income Statement, Balance Sheet - BS is last cause we need the NI/NL figure

* Create the AR aging and AP aging report

* Bonus: Create Account Transaction Report

* Bonus: Use Autocompletion plugin
